Let's follow these points to make developers life easier

1. Inculde tests for all the code we write.
2. Document all the code and modules. Put extra comments to 
   explain the code if you feel the code doesn't explain itself.
   Follow any documention style but just be consistent with it.
3. Please use the git development model (Explained in git-flow.txt).
   There are other workflows as well. I find the above simple and 
   elegant.
