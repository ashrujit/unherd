Design principles
=================

1. Make code modular. Whenever possible make code
   reusable by making a separate library to reuse the utility code.
2. Do **NOT** hard code any config values in the code. 
	 Write all the modules with configurable parameters. Read this parameters from 
   separate config files.
3. Put fail check and throw exception wherever required.


Development principles
======================

Let's follow these points to make developers life easier

1. Inculde tests for all the code we write.
2. Document all the code and modules. Put extra comments to 
   explain the code if you feel the code doesn't explain itself.
   Follow any documention style but just be consistent with it.
3. Please use the git development model (Explained in git-flow.txt).
   There are other workflows as well. I find the above simple and 
   elegant.
4. Always get code reviewed by at least one more developer before
   pushing the code.
